# The manifest dictates what version we're using of each artifact (and which repo to download them from).

# Comments and whitespace can e.g. be used to group by OS (as below), or tool (e.g. all Nasm in one group).

# Note that because we use 'EnforceManifest', we also need to list 7za (as used internally by Stevedore).
